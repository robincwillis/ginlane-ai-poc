       "We're not your typical agency - we're a design studio that's deeply rooted in both New York's tech scene and the evolution of digital brands. Our approach combines the sharp edge of technology with genuine human warmth, which is pretty rare to find.\n",
       "\n",
       "What really sets us apart is our philosophy and track record. We built our reputation helping create and scale some of the most successful direct-to-consumer brands during the DTC 1.0 era through Gin Lane. Now with Little Plains, we're focused on what's next - DTC 2.0, AI-driven brands, and new digital commerce models.\n",
       "\n",
       "A few key things make us different:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. We take equity positions in select projects we truly believe in - meaning we're not just service providers, we're partners invested in long-term success. You can see this with brands like JAJA, Infinite Garden, and Aspects Big Sky.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Our process is built around empathy, design excellence, and hospitality - we strip away the unnecessary to create experiences that actually connect with people. It's not just about making things look pretty; it's about making them work beautifully.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. We move fast but think deep. Our sprint-based approach keeps projects moving while our strategic thinking ensures we're solving the right problems.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Our team brings together experts across design, branding, tech, and growth - all working together to build brands that can scale. We've helped launch everything from premium tequila brands to AI-powered insurance platforms.\n",
       "\n",
       "Most importantly, we're focused on results. For example, with Infinite Garden, we launched 10 complete brands in just 6 months while building out their AI-powered formulation system. That's the kind of impact we aim for - real business outcomes, not just pretty designs."

       "Hey there! We're doing some pretty exciting stuff with AI at Little Plains, really focusing on making it practical and meaningful for our clients. Let me paint you a picture of how we're using it:\n",
       "\n",
       "For starters, we're blending AI with human creativity to develop dynamic content and personalized experiences. Think smart websites that adapt to user behavior, AI-powered content generation that still feels genuinely human, and automated systems that actually make sense for users.\n",
       "\n",
       "We're particularly proud of our approach to implementing AI solutions that:\n",
       "- Streamline workflows while keeping the human touch\n",
       "- Create personalized user experiences that feel natural, not robotic\n",
       "- Help businesses scale efficiently through smart automation\n",
       "- Enhance content creation and distribution\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, with some of our clients, we've built real-time systems that use AI to present product data with contextual information (like what we did with running data), and we've developed AI-enabled marketing strategies that adapt in real-time to maximize impact.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our tech stack typically includes tools like OpenAI's GPT, Pinecone for vector databases, and custom-built solutions using React for the frontend. But here's the thing - we're not just throwing AI at everything. We're super focused on making sure it actually enhances the human experience rather than replacing it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Typically, these kinds of AI implementation projects run anywhere from $75,000 to $250,000, depending on the scope and complexity, and can take anywhere from 8-16 weeks to properly implement.\n",
