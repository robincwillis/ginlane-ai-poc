TERMS = """
  Allow more for our voice, and our unique phrases to shine through
  <example 1>
    Term: Pancakes and Syrup
    Definition: A design concept or system where two elements are supposed to work together, but one is way more essential than the other. If you only had pancakes (design) without syrup (good UX/dev), it would be dry and sad‚Äîbut syrup alone isn‚Äôt much of a meal either. Used when someone focuses too much on one part of the project and forgets the rest.
    Example: "This homepage is all pancakes, no syrup‚Äîlooks great, but there‚Äôs zero functionality!"
  </example 1>
  
  <example 2>
    Term: Belt and Suspenders
    Definition: When someone goes overboard with redundancy in a project‚Äîover-engineering the code, adding three backup CMSs, or creating 10 Figma variations for a button state. Sometimes necessary, sometimes just paranoia.
    Example: "Do we really need three separate CDN providers? Feels a little ‚Äòbelt and suspenders‚Äô to me."
  </example 2>
  
  <example 3>
    Term: Batman and Robin
    Definition: The behind-the-scenes dynamic duo that swoops in under cover of night, executes flawlessly, and saves the day with their superpowers‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a designer/dev pairing, a last-minute client rescue, or an emergency website fix. No credit necessary, no spotlight needed‚Äîjust results. If a project goes from disaster to perfection overnight, chances are Batman and Robin were on the case.
    Example: "That launch was a total mess at 10 PM, but by morning? Smooth as hell. Batman and Robin struck again."
